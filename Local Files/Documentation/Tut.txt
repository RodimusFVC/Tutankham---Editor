Map coordinate system (in CPU/Code roms m1/m2): 
  - XX    coordinates are in 0x08 increments, starting from the bottom of the screen at 0x00 and ending at the top of the map window at 0x55
  - YY YY coordinates are in 0x08 increments, starting from the left side of the screen at 0x0000, and ending at x01F8
Map CPU/Code Blocks:
  - 14 Items (AA 00 00 00 00 YY YY XX 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 TT), no separators between them
  - 0x00 Separator (00)
  - 6 Teleports (YY YY BR TR), with x00000000 after each (00 00 00 00)
  - 0x00 Separator (00)
  - 7 Spawns (YY YY XX), with x00 after each (00)

Items:
  - AA 00 00 00 00 YY YY XX 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 TT, where AA = Active/Inactive (01/00), XX as above, YY YY as above, and TT=tile ID
  - Keys are only 'accessable' from the side, and as such can only be placed into Tile 0x22
  - Treasure Boxes are only 'accessable' from below, and as such can only be placed into Tile 0x4A
  - Rings are only 'accessable' from above, and as such can only be placed into Tile 0x21
Teleports:
  - Editor should always create teleports in pairs, and ensure that they're in the same 'YY YY' column address
  - Editor should enclose these with the 'column' enclosures as a 'block paste' like the 'Door' - both at the Graphics and Physical layer, plus the Code Mapping
  - YY YY BR TR, where YY YY as above, BR = XX of Bottom Row, TR = XX of Top Row
Spawns:
  - Editor should enclose these with the 'brick' enclosures as a 'block paste' like the 'Door' - both at the Graphics and Physical layer, plus the Code Mapping
  - YY YY XX, where YY YY as above and XX as above

Things to Test
  - Can Items/Teleporters be in XX of 0x00 or 0x55?  NO.
  - Teleports may not need the internal separator block - that may just be spacing and not using up all the possible spots
  - Maybe 8 spawns?  need to test the final block spot.

The game's code keeps a checksum for the title screen's copyright symbol. If the checksum fails (the copyright symbol is altered or removed), the game will not boot. I don't know WHERE this checksum is, but if we ever make a full graphics editor subsystem for the game, we should keep this in mind.
  - This checksum seems to be stored at 0xE25/0xE26 in 3j.3h/3a.3h cpu/code roms.  The Konami (3j) checksum is (14 A3), the Stern (3a) checksum is (1A 4C)

CE12 LDX   #$F5C0 - This is the base address of the memory location (or 5CO bytes into the ROM file that we're trying to hack)
CE15 LDY   #$0066 - I think this is a Loop Counter for 66 bytes to be read, but I could be wrong.
CE19 CLRA         - Clearing the A register for use in checksum calculation, I think
CE1A CLRB         - Clearing the B register for use in checksum calculation, I think
CD1B ADDB  ,X+    - Add Contents of X To B Register
CE1D ADCA  #$00   - Add 0x00 to B Register ?  Does this clear sign bits to keep it in range?
CE1F LEAY  -$1, Y - Decrement Counter?  Address?  What is this doing?
CE21 BNE   $CE1B  - Loop back to ADDB to add again, clear bits, and decrement counter until... 
CE23 CMPD  #$14A3 - The money shot - are we equal to the checksum?
CE27 LBNE  $CCBB  - Go off and crash the game if we failed the checksum, otherwise continue standard execution...

Map 1/D1 : F0 F8 B0 FF B0
Map 2/D1 : E0 F0 B0 FF B0
Map 3/D1 : E0 F0 B0 FF B0
Map 4/D1 : E0 F0 B0 FF E0
Map 1/D2 : E0 F0 B0 FF D0

The Editor representation of the X Coordinate is 'flipped' in the sense that it's top down instead of bottom up like the code in the rom - we should reverse it
