Big door :
|Map Width | Bottom Left Door Tile | Row, Col 
|0         | 0x08, 0x0058          | R10, C11
|1         | 0x08, 0x00D8          | R10, C27
|2         | 0x08, 0x0158          | R10, C43
|3         | 0x08, 0x01D8          | R10, C59

In c6/c7, the Door is always the same byte setups:
MAP 1:
  Logical pos (row=27, col=3): Bytes = 55 06
  Logical pos (row=28, col=2): Bytes = F0 66
  Logical pos (row=28, col=3): Bytes = F6 6E
  Logical pos (row=28, col=4): Bytes = 00 06
  Logical pos (row=29, col=2): Bytes = F0 00
  Logical pos (row=29, col=3): Bytes = F6 06

MAP 2:
  Logical pos (row=59, col=3): Bytes = 55 06
  Logical pos (row=60, col=2): Bytes = F0 66
  Logical pos (row=60, col=3): Bytes = F6 6E
  Logical pos (row=60, col=4): Bytes = 00 06
  Logical pos (row=61, col=2): Bytes = F0 00
  Logical pos (row=61, col=3): Bytes = F6 06

MAP 3:
  Logical pos (row=59, col=3): Bytes = 55 06
  Logical pos (row=60, col=2): Bytes = F0 66
  Logical pos (row=60, col=3): Bytes = F6 6E
  Logical pos (row=60, col=4): Bytes = 00 06
  Logical pos (row=61, col=2): Bytes = F0 00
  Logical pos (row=61, col=3): Bytes = F6 06

MAP 4:
  Logical pos (row=59, col=3): Bytes = 55 06
  Logical pos (row=60, col=2): Bytes = F0 66
  Logical pos (row=60, col=3): Bytes = F6 6E
  Logical pos (row=60, col=4): Bytes = 00 06
  Logical pos (row=61, col=2): Bytes = F0 00
  Logical pos (row=61, col=3): Bytes = F6 06

Notes:
Treasure Box on Map 1 - Graphic (0x62) Located at 0x705, with the X/Y coordinates memory addresses (0x6FC,0x6FD), but if I move it, then it only moves the graphic.  The actual treasure remains in the original location, so this must be a split representation - one which shows the tile and one which holds the actual physical location.  In order to move the graphic left and right, it has to be done in 0x08 chunks.  positive increments on the x value moves it to the right.  Positive increments on the y value moves it up, and reducing moves it down.  So this seems to be an absolute pixel location on the screen. If I give it a value outside the map area (0x60 for example), it does display it up in non-scrolling area - so this leads me to believe it's not a 'map' coordinate, just a screen display.   Actual X/Y values are (x038,x010)
Key on Map 1 - Graphic (0x70) Located at 0x685.  Coordinates at memory addresss (0x67C,0x67D)     Actual X/Y values are (x078,0x50)

When I moved the key, it prevented me from picking it up.  Strange.  Why?

Map coordinate system (in CPU/Code roms m1/m2): 
  - XX    coordinates are in 0x08 increments, starting from the bottom of the screen at 0x00 and ending at the top of the map window at 0x55
  - YY YY coordinates are in 0x08 increments, starting from the left side of the screen at 0x0000, and ending at x01F8
Map CPU/Code Blocks:
  - 14 Items (AA 00 00 00 00 YY YY XX 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 TT), no separators between them
  - 0x00 Separator (00)
  - 6 Teleports (YY YY BR TR), with x00000000 after each (00 00 00 00)
  - 0x00 Separator (00)
  - 7 Spawns (YY YY XX), with x00 after each (00)

Items:
  - AA 00 00 00 00 YY YY XX 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 TT, where AA = Active/Inactive (01/00), XX as above, YY YY as above, and TT=tile ID
  - Keys are only 'accessable' from the side, and as such can only be placed into Tile 0x22
  - Treasure Boxes are only 'accessable' from below, and as such can only be placed into Tile 0x4A
  - Rings are only 'accessable' from above, and as such can only be placed into Tile 0x21
Teleports:
  - Editor should always create teleports in pairs, and ensure that they're in the same 'YY YY' column address
  - Editor should enclose these with the 'column' enclosures as a 'block paste' like the 'Door' - both at the Graphics and Physical layer, plus the Code Mapping
  - YY YY BR TR, where YY YY as above, BR = XX of Bottom Row, TR = XX of Top Row
Spawns:
  - Editor should enclose these with the 'brick' enclosures as a 'block paste' like the 'Door' - both at the Graphics and Physical layer, plus the Code Mapping
  - YY YY XX, where YY YY as above and XX as above

Things to Test
  - Can Items/Teleporters be in XX of 0x00 or 0x55?  NO.
  - Teleports may not need the internal separator block - that may just be spacing and not using up all the possible spots
  - Maybe 8 spawns?  need to test the final block spot.

The game's code keeps a checksum for the title screen's copyright symbol. If the checksum fails (the copyright symbol is altered or removed), the game will not boot. I don't know WHERE this checksum is, but if we ever make a full graphics editor subsystem for the game, we should keep this in mind.
  - This checksum seems to be stored at 0xE25/0xE26 in 3j.3h/3a.3h cpu/code roms.  The Konami (3j) checksum is (14 A3), the Stern (3a) checksum is (1A 4C)

CE12 LDX   #$F5C0 - This is the base address of the memory location (or 5CO bytes into the ROM file that we're trying to hack)
CE15 LDY   #$0066 - I think this is a Loop Counter for 66 bytes to be read, but I could be wrong.
CE19 CLRA         - Clearing the A register for use in checksum calculation, I think
CE1A CLRB         - Clearing the B register for use in checksum calculation, I think
CD1B ADDB  ,X+    - Add Contents of X To B Register
CE1D ADCA  #$00   - Add 0x00 to B Register ?  Does this clear sign bits to keep it in range?
CE1F LEAY  -$1, Y - Decrement Counter?  Address?  What is this doing?
CE21 BNE   $CE1B  - Loop back to ADDB to add again, clear bits, and decrement counter until... 
CE23 CMPD  #$14A3 - The money shot - are we equal to the checksum?
CE27 LBNE  $CCBB  - Go off and crash the game if we failed the checksum, otherwise continue standard execution...

Map 1/D1 : F0 F8 B0 FF B0
Map 2/D1 : E0 F0 B0 FF B0
Map 3/D1 : E0 F0 B0 FF B0
Map 4/D1 : E0 F0 B0 FF E0
Map 1/D2 : E0 F0 B0 FF D0

The Editor representation of the X Coordinate is 'flipped' in the sense that it's top down instead of bottom up like the code in the rom - we should reverse it
